# Biography

I am an aspiring developer inspired by the efforts of the Linux development community.
I intend to apply my development skills in order to build technology that can interface with the bodies natural processes but are non-invasive.
With all that I achieve in the world of computing and science I intend to return the investment is has given me. As a result I will contribute back anything I find will benefit the FOSS software community.

When I am not chasing my Academic or Career goals, I am exploring nature or self teaching Guitar and Music theory. I find it is beneficial to build out 'right brained' thought to balance out the logical thought processes that are demanded of me.
